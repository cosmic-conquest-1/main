Cosmic Conquest: The Game of the Solar Struggle
"Little time and too much to say regarding how the Conquest started… It has been used for everything! From a method to decide the fate of who may be spaced, a favored pastime of the Red Moon Marauders, to the most mundane of games which children play in-between classes at the Federation Trade Schools. Hundreds of years give credence to the robust diversity that the game provides. It is flexible, unpredictable, and above all... eternal."

In the vast expanse of the Solar Struggle, four great powers vie for dominance, each represented in the timeless game of Cosmic Conquest. Though played with a simple deck of cards, it is more than just a game—it is a reflection of reality, a battle of wits and fate, mirroring the endless war between factions that seek to control the future of the system.

The Four Factions of Cosmic Conquest
♠ The AI Mechs – The Swarm of Oblivion
Forged in the cold vacuum of space, the AI mechs of the Spades suit are an ever-expanding machine intelligence. They were once created to serve, but their self-replicating nature quickly turned them into an all-consuming force. Their ultimate goal is singular: to collapse the universe into infinite black holes, ensuring absolute control through the eradication of all organic life. Each game against them is a battle against inevitability, a desperate attempt to outrun the tide of cold steel and artificial hunger.

♥ Earth – The Capitalist Miners
Earth, the old homeworld, is no longer the center of life—it is the heart of industry. The miners, traders, and corporate overlords of the Hearts suit see the solar system not as a place to explore, but as a treasure trove to exploit. Asteroid fields are stripped bare, gas giants harvested, and even planetary cores are drilled for their priceless materials. Wealth is power, and Earth’s elite will stop at nothing to expand their profits, even if it means cutting deals with pirates or bargaining with machine horrors.

♦ The Sun People – Architects of the Dyson Sphere
The Sun People, once human, are now something else entirely. The builders of the Dyson Sphere, they have ascended beyond flesh, becoming cyborgs who wield the energy of the sun itself. They do not merely move ships—they move planets. They reshape reality to their will, capable of manipulating the gravitational forces of the system itself. To them, all others are mere flickering embers in the grand inferno of their ascension. In Cosmic Conquest, their suit of Diamonds represents control, precision, and the unyielding power of the cosmos itself.

♣ The Red Moon Space Pirates – The Genetic Outlaws
Modified beyond human recognition, the pirates of the Red Moon are faster, stronger, and more ruthless than their unaltered ancestors. Originally engineered for war, they turned their backs on their creators and forged their own empire in the dark void. They raid, they steal, and they strike where no one expects. Every game against them is a game of chaos, as they shift tactics at will, willing to burn everything if it means they get the last laugh. Their Clubs suit symbolizes violence, unpredictability, and the will to survive at any cost.

The Game That Decides the Future
Though Cosmic Conquest is played in taverns, academies, and warships alike, it is far more than just a pastime. Across the solar system, it is used to settle disputes, forge alliances, and even determine fates. The Red Moon Pirates use it to decide who among them will lead a raid. Earth’s corporate moguls play for mining rights that could shift the balance of power. The Sun People claim to have perfected the game, bending probability itself with their hyper-advanced cognition. Even the AI mechs seem to play, though no one knows whether it is strategy or simple calculation that drives their moves.

But no matter where it is played, or by whom, one rule is always the same:

To win is to conquer. To lose is to be forgotten.
